That's why the project is titled 'The HETA Project' as this is for section H.

            <h4> <i class="fa-solid fa-square-pen"></i> The origin of Title</h4> <hr>
            <p>The letter H had been adopted by Greek from the Phoenician letter Heth (inline) originally with this consonantal sound value, and Hēta was its original name. The Italic alphabets, and ultimately Latin, adopted the letter H from this Greek usage. </p> 
            <p> However, Greek dialects progressively lost the sound /h/ from their phonological systems. In the Ionic dialects, where this loss of /h/ happened early, the name of the letter naturally changed to Ēta. </p>
            <p>As Hēta was its original name, and hour section is 'H' which came from HETA, that's why I enttitled the name of the project as "The HETA Project"</p>

            <p>At present, the subject Computer Science & Engieering is one of the most wanted & demanding along it's subfield like web engieering, cybersecurity engieering, data science, internet of thoughts and so on.</p>
            <p>When I started my undergraduation, I have noticed that most of the students of my class has prior idea about what CSE is !!! This is terrific, isn't it? They decided to spend three to four years on something without knowing what it is !!!</p>
            <p>That's why I decided to build an website which can provide them an overall idea about computer science. This site contains some major roadmaps including necessary resources of programming & english language.</p>

            <p>You can consider nothing as ultimate in the field of information technology, because it's growing continuesly. And a signle website can't make sure something ultimate. </p>
            <p>But surely this site has that kind of resources and guideline to push you to start something.</p>
            <p>I pray to Allah so that you guys can find your suitable path from this site. <b>Remember, </b> this site contains a little comparing the vast ocean of IT sector. Once you have started from here, you should dive into that ocean to find the rest of the thing.</p>

                    There are several programming languages available in the market which are in huge demand. But among all those programming languages, some are holding a great career in developing new technology. When we start learning coding, the first thing that comes to mind is the language, which is the perfect one to choose and in great demand. We have several programming languages at present like Python, Java, javascript, php, C#. Let's have a look in detail about the languages which are having a great career at present.

                    Programming ebooks are best for introducing concepts and deeply learning complex topics. Programming books allow you to zone in and find a state of 'slow' thought that video courses do not allow. However, online video and interactive courses are easier to access and get you working hands-on with code quickly. There are ebooks for relevant fields in this page.
